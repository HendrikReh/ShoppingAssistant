# Show me the 3 best reviewed TV Ear buds

You: Show me the 3 best reviewed TV Ear buds
Thinking about: 'the 3 best reviewed TV Ear buds'
Assistant: Here are the three best‑reviewed TV earbuds from your list, with quick notes on why they’re good for TV use and any important caveats:

1) Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)
- Why: Excellent active noise cancellation, Adaptive Transparency, low perceived latency and very good spatial audio when used with Apple TV/iPhone — great for movies/TV dialogue and immersive sound.
- Best for: Apple ecosystem users (Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Mac).
- Caveat: Low latency and spatial features work best with Apple devices; other TVs may show more lip‑sync delay.

2) Bose QuietComfort Earbuds
- Why: Top‑tier noise cancelling and high‑fidelity sound — helps you hear dialogue clearly in noisy rooms. Comfortable for long viewing sessions and good battery life with the case.
- Best for: Users who want powerful ANC and balanced sound for movies/TV.
- Caveat: Like most Bluetooth earbuds, latency can vary by TV; may need a low‑latency Bluetooth transmitter for perfectly synced audio on some TVs.

3) Shure AONIC 215 (wired, sound‑isolating)
- Why: Sound‑isolating wired earbuds with excellent clarity and very low (practically zero) latency when plugged directly into the TV’s headphone/line out. Durable, comfortable, and tuned for accurate sound.
- Best for: TVs with a wired headphone jack or for users who prioritize zero latency and accurate audio (ideal for lip‑sync and critical listening).
- Caveat: Wired connection limits mobility; many newer TVs lack a headphone jack — may require an adapter.

Quick buying tip: if your TV doesn’t support a low‑latency Bluetooth codec, use either a wired solution (like the Shure AONIC 215) or buy a compatible low‑latency (aptX LL) Bluetooth transmitter to pair with wireless earbuds to avoid lip‑sync issues.
