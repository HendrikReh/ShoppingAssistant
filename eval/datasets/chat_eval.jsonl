Look for USB-C cables with Power Delivery (PD) support for fastest charging. Check cable specifications for wattage rating (18W, 30W, 65W, etc.)."}
{"question": "What should I consider when buying a wireless router?", "reference_answer": "Consider WiFi standard (WiFi 6/6E recommended), coverage area, number of devices, internet speed plan, security features (WPA3), Quality of Service (QoS) options, number of ethernet ports, and whether you need mesh capability for larger homes. Dual-band minimum, tri-band for heavy use."}
{"question": "Are expensive HDMI cables worth it?", "reference_answer": "For most uses, expensive HDMI cables offer no benefit over certified basic cables. All digital HDMI cables meeting the spec deliver identical picture quality. Only buy premium for very long runs (25+ feet), in-wall installation requiring CL-rated cables, or specific features like ultra-slim design or reinforced connectors."}
{"question": "What's the ideal keyboard layout for productivity?", "reference_answer": "For productivity, consider tenkeyless (TKL) or 75% layouts that save desk space while keeping function keys.

{"question": "How do I choose between IPS, VA, and TN monitor panels?", "reference_answer": "IPS panels offer best color accuracy and viewing angles for creative work. VA panels provide superior contrast ratios ideal for movies and gaming in dark rooms. TN panels have fastest response times but poor colors/angles, suitable for competitive gaming only. IPS is best all-around choice for most users."}
{"question": "What capacity power bank do I need for travel?", "reference_answer": "For travel, 10,000mAh charges most phones 2-3 times and stays under airline limits. 20,000mAh handles multiple devices or extended trips.

{"question": "Should I get wired or wireless gaming headphones?", "reference_answer": "Wired headphones offer zero latency, no battery concerns, and often better audio quality per dollar. Wireless provides freedom of movement and cleaner setup. Modern low-latency wireless (2.4GHz dongles) nearly matches wired performance. Consider your setup, budget, and whether you game at a desk or couch."}
{"question": "What makes a mouse good for both work and gaming?", "reference_answer": "Look for adjustable DPI (800-3200 for work, higher for gaming), comfortable ergonomics for long sessions, quiet clicks for office use, wireless with long battery life, and customizable buttons that can switch profiles between work and gaming modes.
